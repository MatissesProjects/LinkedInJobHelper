# LinkedInJobHelper

The goal of this project is to help with the jobs section of linkedin

There are a lot of companies that post and have very vague information that makes the post seem fake, and there are a few other indicators

I want to have a system that can help me cross out the items that seem to be fake
highlight the ones that seem to be good and from interesting companies

an interesting company is one that seems like they are building something that might be useful and fun

I want to be able to toggle different filters in the extension window, and have them effect the page directly
